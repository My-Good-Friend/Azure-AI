***Azure*** ***AI***

Azure AI Language is a cloud-based service that provides services for
developers to build cognitive intelligence into applications without
having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge and for data
scientists to build, deploy and manage AI applications. Azure is also
commonly used as a platform for hosting databases in a cloud. The main
purpose of Azure management services is to help users manage their cloud
infrastructure more effectively and securely.

**Open** **AI**

Azure Open AI Service is a part of Microsoft Azure’s AI services that
provides REST API access to Open AI’s powerful language models1. It
includes models like GPT-4, GPT-35-Turbo, and the Embeddings model
series1. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task
including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic
search, and natural language to code translation. Here are some key
features of Azure Open AI Service:

> • Models available: GPT-4 series, GPT-35-Turbo series, and Embeddings
> series.
>
> • Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning is currently unavailable to new customers.
>
> • Price: Pricing details are available on the oficial website.
>
> • Virtual network support & private link support: Yes, unless using
> Azure OpenAI on your data.
>
> • Managed Identity: Yes, via Azure Active Directory.
>
> • UI experience: Azure portal for account & resource management, Azure
> Open AI Service Studio for model exploration and fine tuning.
>
> **Vision**

Azure AI Vision is a unified service provided by Microsoft Azure that
offers innovative computer vision capabilities1. It gives your
applications the ability to analyze images, read text, and detect faces
with prebuilt image tagging, text extraction with optical character
recognition (OCR), and responsible facial recognition. Here are some of
the key services offered by Azure AI Vision:

> • **Optical** **Character** **Recognition** **(OCR)**: This service
> extracts text from images. It can extract printed and handwritten text
> from photos and documents using deep-learning-based models.
>
> • **Image** **Analysis**: This service extracts many visual features
> from images, such as objects, faces, adult content, and auto-generated
> text descriptions.
>
> • **Face**: This service provides AI algorithms that detect,
> recognize, and analyse human faces in images.
>
> • **Spatial** **Analysis**: This service analyses the presence and
> movement of people on a video feed and produces events that other
> systems can respond to.

**Language**

Azure AI Language is a managed service provided by Microsoft Azure for
developing natural language processing applications12. Here are some of
the key features:

> • **Named** **Entity** **Recognition** **(NER)**: This preconfigured
> feature categorizes entities (words or phrases) in unstructured text
> across several predefined category groups.
>
> • **Personally** **Identifying** **(PII)** **and** **Health**
> **(PHI)** **Information** **Detection**: This preconfigured feature
> identifies, categorizes, and redacts sensitive information in both
> unstructured text documents, and conversation transcripts.
>
> • **Language** **Detection**: This preconfigured feature can detect
> the language a document is written in and returns a language code for
> a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some
> regional/cultural languages.
>
> • **Sentiment** **Analysis** **and** **Opinion** **Mining**: These
> preconfigured features help you find out what people think of your
> brand or topic by mining text for clues about positive or negative
> sentiment and can associate them with specific aspects of the text.
>
> • **Summarization**: This preconfigured feature uses extractive text
> summarization to produce a summary of documents and conversation
> transcriptions.
>
> • **Customizable** **Multilingual** **Models**: Provide a few labeled
> examples to train your machine learning model for your specific use
> case. Custom multilingual models can be trained in one language and
> used for multiple other languages.
>
> • **Label** **Data** **Instantly** **with** **Azure** **Open** **AI**
> **Service**: Access GPT-powered advanced language models through
> Language Studio to quickly scan and suggest labels for your content.

**Containers** **in** **Azure** **AI** **Services**

Azure AI services provide several [<u>Docker
containers</u>](https://www.docker.com/what-container) that let you use
the same APIs that are available in Azure, on-premises. Using these
containers gives you the flexibility to bring Azure AI services closer
to your data for compliance, security or other operational reasons.
Container support is currently available for a subset of Azure AI
services.

Azure AI services offer several containers to use AI on premises. These
containers provide the flexibility to bring Azure AI services closer to
your data for compliance, security, or other operational reasons1. Here
are some of the Azure AI services that are available in containers:

> • **Vision** **Containers**: These include services like OCR and
> Spatial Analysis.
>
> • **Language** **Containers**: These include services like Sentiment
> Analysis, Key Phrase Extraction, Text Language Detection, Text
> Analytics for Health, LUIS Container, Custom Named Entity Recognition,
> and Translator Container.
>
> • **Speech** **Containers**: These include services like Speech to
> Text, Custom Speech to Text, Neural Text to Speech, and Speech
> Language Identification1.
>
> • **Decision** **Container**: This includes the Anomaly Detector
> service.
>
> • **Disconnected** **Containers**: These are containers that can run
> disconnected from the internet.

Each of these containers contains a subset of functionality from
services in Azure AI services. The core AI technology, pricing tiers,
API keys, and API signature are the same between the container and the
corresponding cloud services.
