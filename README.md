# *Azure* *AI*

Azure AI Language is a cloud-based service that provides services for
developers to build cognitive intelligence into applications without
having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge and for data
scientists to build, deploy and manage AI applications. Azure is also
commonly used as a platform for hosting databases in a cloud. The main
purpose of Azure management services is to help users manage their cloud
infrastructure more effectively and securely.

> • **Summarization**: This preconfigured feature uses extractive text
> summarization to produce a summary of documents and conversation
> transcriptions.
>
> • **Customizable** **Multilingual** **Models**: Provide a few labeled
> examples to train your machine learning model for your specific use
> case. Custom multilingual models can be trained in one language and
> used for multiple other languages.

**Containers** **in** **Azure** **AI** **Services**

Azure AI services provide several Docker
containers  that let you use
the same APIs that are available in Azure, on-premises. Using these
containers gives you the flexibility to bring Azure AI services closer
to your data for compliance, security or other operational reasons.
Container support is currently available for a subset of Azure AI
services.

Azure AI services offer several containers to use AI on premises. These
containers provide the flexibility to bring Azure AI services closer to
your data for compliance, security, or other operational reasons1. Here
are some of the Azure AI services that are available in containers:

> • **Vision** **Containers**: These include services like OCR and
> Spatial Analysis.
>
> • **Language** **Containers**: These include services like Sentiment
> Analysis, Key Phrase Extraction, Text Language Detection, Text
> Analytics for Health, LUIS Container, Custom Named Entity Recognition,
> and Translator Container.
>
> • **Speech** **Containers**: These include services like Speech to
> Text, Custom Speech to Text, Neural Text to Speech, and Speech
> Language Identification.

> • **Decision** **Container**: This includes the Anomaly Detector
> service.
>
> • **Disconnected** **Containers**: These are containers that can run
> disconnected from the internet.

Each of these containers contains a subset of functionality from
services in Azure AI services. The core AI technology, pricing tiers,
API keys, and API signature are the same between the container and the
corresponding cloud services.

### **Azure** **OpenAI** **Service** **Models**

*AI* *Models*

**o1-preview** **and** **o1-mini** **models** **limited** **access**

The Azure OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini models are specifically designed to tackle reasoning and problem-solving tasks with increased focus and capability. These models spend more time processing and understanding the user's request, making them exceptionally strong in areas like science, coding, and math compared to previous iterations.
> o1-preview : The most capable model in the o1 series, offering enhanced reasoning abilities.
> o1-mini :  A faster and more cost-efficient option in the o1 series, ideal for coding tasks requiring speed and lower resource consumption.

**GPT-4o** **audio**

The gpt-4o-realtime-preview model is part of the GPT-4o model family and supports low-latency, "speech in, speech out" conversational interactions. GPT-4o audio is designed to handle real-time, low-latency conversational interactions, making it a great fit for support agents, assistants, translators, and other use cases that need highly responsive back-and-forth with a user.
> gpt-4o-realtime-preview : Audio model for real-time audio processing

**GPT-4**

GPT-4 is the predecessor to GPT-4 Turbo. Both the GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo models have a base model name of gpt-4. You can distinguish between the GPT-4 and Turbo models by examining the model version.
>gpt-4 Version 0314
>gpt-4 Version 0613
>gpt-4-32k Version 0613

**Embeddings**

text-embedding-3-large is the latest and most capable embedding model. Upgrading between embeddings models is not possible. In order to move from using text-embedding-ada-002 to text-embedding-3-large you would need to generate new embeddings.
>text-embedding-3-large
>text-embedding-3-small
>text-embedding-ada-002

The third generation embeddings models support reducing the size of the embedding via a new dimensions parameter. Typically larger embeddings are more expensive from a compute, memory, and storage perspective. Being able to adjust the number of dimensions allows more control over overall cost and performance. The dimensions parameter is not supported in all versions of the OpenAI 1.x Python library, to take advantage of this parameter we recommend upgrading to the latest version: pip install openai --upgrade.

OpenAI's MTEB benchmark testing found that even when the third generation model's dimensions are reduced to less than text-embeddings-ada-002 1,536 dimensions performance remains slightly better.

**DALL-E**

The DALL-E models generate images from text prompts that the user provides. DALL-E 3 is generally available for use with the REST APIs. DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 with client SDKs are in preview.

**Whisper**

The Whisper model is a speech to text model from OpenAI that you can use to transcribe audio files. The model is trained on a large dataset of English audio and text. The model is optimized for transcribing audio files that contain speech in English. The model can also be used to transcribe audio files that contain speech in other languages. The output of the model is English text.
