# Azure-AI
Azure AI Language is a cloud-based service that provides services for developers to build cognitive intelligence into applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge and for data scientists to build , deploy and manage AI applications. Azure is also commonly used as a platform for hosting databases in a cloud. The main purpose of Azure management services is to help users manage their cloud infrastructure more effectively and securely.

**Open AI**
Azure Open AI Service is a part of Microsoft Azure’s AI services that provides REST API access to Open AI’s powerful language models1. It includes models like GPT-4, GPT-35-Turbo, and the Embeddings model series1. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Here are some key features of Azure Open AI Service:
1.Models available: GPT-4 series, GPT-35-Turbo series, and Embeddings series.
2.Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning is currently unavailable to new customers.
3.Price: Pricing details are available on the official website.
4.Virtual network support & private link support: Yes, unless using Azure OpenAI on your data.
5.Managed Identity: Yes, via Azure Active Directory.
6.UI experience: Azure portal for account & resource management, Azure Open AI Service Studio for model exploration and fine tuning.
**Vision**
Azure AI Vision is a unified service provided by Microsoft Azure that offers innovative computer vision capabilities1. It gives your applications the ability to analyze images, read text, and detect faces with prebuilt image tagging, text extraction with optical character recognition (OCR), and responsible facial recognition. Here are some of the key services offered by Azure AI Vision:
1.***Optical Character Recognition (OCR)***: This service extracts text from images. It can extract printed and handwritten text from photos and documents using deep-learning-based models.
2.***Image Analysis***: This service extracts many visual features from images, such as objects, faces, adult content, and auto-generated text descriptions.
3.***Face***: This service provides AI algorithms that detect, recognize, and analyze human faces in images.
4.***Spatial Analysis***: This service analyzes the presence and movement of people on a video feed and produces events that other systems can respond to.
**Language**
Azure AI Language is a managed service provided by Microsoft Azure for developing natural language processing applications12. Here are some of the key features:
1.***Named Entity Recognition (NER)***: This preconfigured feature categorizes entities (words or phrases) in unstructured text across several predefined category groups.
2.***Personally Identifying (PII) and Health (PHI) Information Detection***: This preconfigured feature identifies, categorizes, and redacts sensitive information in both unstructured text documents, and conversation transcripts.
3.***Language Detection***: This preconfigured feature can detect the language a document is written in and returns a language code for a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional/cultural languages.
4.***Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining***: These preconfigured features help you find out what people think of your brand or topic by mining text for clues about positive or negative sentiment and can associate them with specific aspects of the text.
5.***Summarization***: This preconfigured feature uses extractive text summarization to produce a summary of documents and conversation transcriptions.
6.***Customizable Multilingual Models***: Provide a few labeled examples to train your machine learning model for your specific use case. Custom multilingual models can be trained in one language and used for multiple other languages.
7.***Label Data Instantly with Azure Open AI Service***: Access GPT-powered advanced language models through Language Studio to quickly scan and suggest labels for your content.
**Containers in Azure AI Services**
Azure AI services provide several Docker containers that let you use the same APIs that are available in Azure, on-premises. Using these containers gives you the flexibility to bring Azure AI services closer to your data for compliance, security or other operational reasons. Container support is currently available for a subset of Azure AI services.

Azure AI services offer several containers to use AI on premises. These containers provide the flexibility to bring Azure AI services closer to your data for compliance, security, or other operational reasons1. Here are some of the Azure AI services that are available in containers:
1.***Vision Containers***: These include services like OCR and Spatial Analysis.
2.***Language Containers***: These include services like Sentiment Analysis, Key Phrase Extraction, Text Language Detection, Text Analytics for Health, LUIS Container, Custom Named Entity Recognition, and Translator Container.
3.***Speech Containers***: These include services like Speech to Text, Custom Speech to Text, Neural Text to Speech, and Speech Language Identification1.
4.***Decision Container***: This includes the Anomaly Detector service.
5.***Disconnected Containers***: These are containers that can run disconnected from the internet.
Each of these containers contains a subset of functionality from services in Azure AI services. The core AI technology, pricing tiers, API keys, and API signature are the same between the container and the corresponding cloud services.
